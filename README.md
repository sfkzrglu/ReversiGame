#Reversi Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic game Reversi, also known as Othello, designed as an object-oriented programming project in C# for the Advanced Object-Oriented Programming course.

##How to Play
The game board consists of an 8x8 grid.
Players take turns placing their colored discs on the board.
A player can only place a disc on an empty square where it will sandwich one or more of the opponent's discs between two of the player's discs. The sandwiched discs are then flipped to the player's color.
The game ends when the board is full or when neither player can make a legal move.
The player with the most discs of their color on the board at the end of the game wins.

##Features
Two players can take turns playing on the same computer.
The game enforces the rules of Reversi, allowing players to make only valid moves.
The game ends automatically when there are no legal moves left for either player.
It is possible to play against computer which makes random moves.

##How to Run
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the solution file in Visual Studio.
Build and run the project.
Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

##Disclaimer
This implementation of Reversi is a simple project created for educational purposes. It may not have all the features or optimizations found in professional game implementations. Feel free to use and modify the code for your own learning and experimentation.
